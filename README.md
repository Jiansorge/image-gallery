# Redfin Coding Screen - Software Engineering - Front End

## Challenge

A web app that retrieves the data from provided photos.

Display this list of photos to the user based on the following requirements:

- show photos in a grid view on initial load
- support a full-screen mode
    - when the user clicks on an image, it will show the entire image fullscreen
    - when the user clicks on a 'close' button or the background, it will close the fullscreen image and return to the grid
- work in Chrome; we will not be evaluating other browsers for compatibility
- support smartphone/tablet (<800px wide) and desktop viewports
- query an API for a set of photos
    - sample data is provided in the attached photos.json, but you must access it via an http request, as if it was an API endpoint
- use only vanilla JavaScript; we won't accept solutions that use frameworks like React, Vue, jQuery, etc.
    - ES6 and any required polyfills are perfectly acceptable, but not required
The final result should be displayed to the user in an easy-to-read list.
